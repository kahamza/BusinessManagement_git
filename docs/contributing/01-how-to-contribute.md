- Follow the code style guidelines
- Write unit tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed

### 4. Commit Your Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "type(scope): concise description of changes"

## üé® Code Style

### Kotlin Style Guide
We follow the [Kotlin Coding Conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html) with the following additions:

#### Naming
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and properties
- Use PascalCase for class names and enums
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Prefix boolean variables with is/has/should (e.g., `isEnabled`, `hasItems`)

#### Formatting
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use trailing commas in multi-line declarations
- Use string templates instead of concatenation

#### Functions
- Keep functions small and focused (max 20-30 lines)
- Use default arguments instead of function overloading
- Use expression functions for simple getters and setters

### XML Style Guide
- Use `snake_case` for resource IDs
- Prefix custom views with the app name (e.g., `bm_button_primary`)
- Organize attributes by category (layout, style, etc.)
- Use `tools:` namespace for preview attributes

## üîç Code Quality

### Static Analysis
We use the following tools to maintain code quality:
- **ktlint** - Code style enforcement
- **detekt** - Static code analysis
- **Android Lint** - Android-specific checks

To run checks locally:
```bash
./gradlew ktlintCheck
detekt
./gradlew lint
```

### Testing
- Write unit tests for all new features
- Aim for at least 70% code coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the Given-When-Then pattern

## üîÑ Pull Request Process

### PR Guidelines
- Keep PRs small and focused on a single feature/bug
- Reference related issues in the PR description
- Ensure all tests pass
- Update documentation as needed
- Request reviews from at least one team member
