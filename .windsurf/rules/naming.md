## Naming Rules
Use consistent naming conventions:
- Entities end with "Entity"
- DAOs end with "Dao"
- ViewModels end with "ViewModel"
- UseCases end with "UseCase"
- Repositories end with "Repository"

Package names should be lowercase and use underscores.

For Business Management App:
- Use camelCase for variables and methods
- Prefix branch-related classes with "Branch"
- Use "Pos" for Point of Sale related classes
- Follow Arabic transliteration for UI strings
